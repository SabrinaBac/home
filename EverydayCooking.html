		<h4> Easy Tzatziki. </h4>
		<img src = "images/tzatziki.jpg" width="400" height = "400" alt = "picture of tzatziki"/> 	
		<ul>
			<li> 1 hothouse cucumber, unpeeled and seeded. </li>
			<li> 2 (7-oz) containers Greek yogurt, such as Fage Total. </li>
			<li> ¼ cup sour cream. </li>
			<li> 2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice. </li>
			<li> 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar. </li>
			<li> 1 Tbsp minced fresh dill. </li>
			<li> 1 ½ tsp minced garlic (2 cloves).</li>
			<li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Directions </h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Place the rosemary, garlic, oregano, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a food processor and process until minced. Add the olive oil and process into a coarse paste.

			<li> Roast the lamb for 25 minutes exactly for medium rare and 30 minutes for medium. Remove from the oven and cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.

		<h4> Easy Tzatziki </h4>
		<p> 1. Grate the cucumber by hand on a box grater, as you would grate carrots. 
		Squeeze the cucumber with your hands to remove a lot (but not all) of the liquid. 
		Place in a medium bowl and stir in the yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar, dill, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 
		Serve cold or at room temperature.</p>
